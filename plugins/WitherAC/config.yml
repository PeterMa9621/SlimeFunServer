# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Welcome to the WitherAntiCheat configuration file!
#
# Last updated in version: 0.20.0
# --> if you're using a newer version of WAC you should check the changelog to see if the config has been updated
#
# IMPORTANT: WAC uses an innovative config format which allows you to configure everything at once, or fine tune each check individually if you want,
# however to properly use this config file you first need to carefully read these comments
#
# WAC's configuration allows you to change each setting for each check individually
# However since many values will be the same for most checks, there's a "General" section which applies for all checks
# You can choose which settings should be used for the majority of checks there, and then override specific settings for specific checks where needed below
# This system makes configuring WAC much easier and keeps the configuration file shorter while retaining all the flexibility
#
# All values are either booleans (true / false) or integers (whole numbers), except for the commands which are strings enclosed in quotation marks
# All time values are in seconds
# You can add your own comments using the '#' character
#
# I tried to document everything as clearly as possible, but if you have any questions or other problems, you can join the WAC Discord:
# https://discord.gg/jjkR2EU
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The general values are the default values and used for all checks that don't override them explicitly below
General:

  # If the check should be enabled
  enable: true

  # If WAC should send notifications about detections
  notify: true
  # How many violations are necessary before WAC starts sending notifications, for example when it's set to 5, the first 4 violations are silent
  notify-threshold: 10
  # How long WAC should wait before sending a new notification (to avoid notification spam)
  notification-delay: 20

  # If WAC should block hacks
  block: true
  # Same as notify-threshold but for blocking
  block-threshold: 10

  # If WAC should kick hackers
  kick: true
  # The command to execute when kicking someone (no / at the start!), %player_name% will be replaced by the kicked player's name
  kick-command: "minecraft:kick %player_name% §4[WAC] §6你被检测到使用 §c作弊软件§6! 如果你想继续在本服务器游玩, §c请关闭任何作弊软件§6!"
  # Same a notify-threshold but for kicking
  kick-threshold: 25
  # If someone was kicked and rejoins immediately, his violations will usually not have expired yet
  # This means that he is still over the kick threshold and will get kicked again immediately on the next violation
  # To prevent that, this option adds a minimum amount of violations that must have happened since the last kick before a player is kicked again
  # This does not replace the normal kick-threshold, it's an addition to prevent the problem described above without changing the violation counter
  rekick-threshold: 10

  # Until which maximum player ping WAC should check players, WAC will not check players who have a higher ping than this
  # Set this to -1 to ignore player ping and always check
  # Warning: Hacked clients can fake a high ping, use this setting carefully and only where necessary
  max-player-ping: -1
  # Until which minimum server TPS WAC should perform checks, if the server TPS are below this value the check will be disabled
  # Set this to -1 to ignore the server TPS and always check
  # Although this is meant to prevent false positives, it can also be used to save performance when the server tps are low
  min-server-tps: -1

  # How long WAC should keep track of violations (or to put it differently, after which time violations are "forgotten" again)
  # This is tracked for each violation individually
  # Set this to -1 to store violations until the server is restarted
  violation-expiry: 900

# You can override each of the values above for individual checks here
# For example if you want the angle check to kick after 50 violations, but want to disable the check for players with a ping over 200, it should look like this:
#
# speed:
#   kick: true
#   kick-threshold: 50
#   max-player-ping: 200

# This check detects if a player is flying inside a boat
# Hacks that can trigger this: BoatFly
boat_fly:
  notify-threshold: 1 # This check is very accurate

# This check detects if a player is sending more packets than normally possible
# Hacks that can trigger this: Timer, Blink
packet_speed:
  notify-threshold: 5 # As long as the user is not lagging a lot, this check is very accurate
  block-threshold: 5
  min-server-tps: 10 # During lag spikes this check can produce false positives, this setting prevents that

# This check detects if a player is sending spoofed packets
# Hacks that can trigger this: NoFall, Jesus, some Fly modes, some Speed modes
packet_spoof:

# This check detects if a player is faking a high ping to bypass checks
# Hacks that can trigger this: Fake Lag, other hacks which try to make the server think you're having a high ping
ping_spoof:
  notify-threshold: 1 # This check is very accurate
  block-threshold: 1

# This check detects if a player can reach further than normally possible
# Hacks that can trigger this: KillAura, Reach
reach:

# This check detects if a player moves faster than normal
# Hacks that can trigger this: Speed hacks (Vanilla, BHop, LowHop etc.), LongJump, Fly (many Fly hacks also make you move faster)
