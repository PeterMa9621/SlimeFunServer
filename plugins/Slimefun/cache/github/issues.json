Create a simple cargo setup consisting of one cargo manager, one cargo input node and one cargo output node\r\n2. Configure the cargo system in such way that it is transferring items into a slimefun managed inventory container, such as the \"Electric Furnace\"\r\n3.

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n -

If your target has a wirlwind talisman the trident will be deflected... wherever... but it can't be picked up again.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the Issue (Required)\r\nHave one player have a whirlwind talisman (or both, but the target must have this).  Throw trident at player (regardless of enchant this is the result, but a loyalty enchanted trident should return to you).  Your target will receive the \"Your talisman deflected the projectile!\" notice... and your trident will be forever stuck in whatever block it got deflected into and unretrievable.\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QaonEBg\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior (Required)\r\nTrident should return to the thrower regardless of the talsman the target has. \r\n\r\n## Server Log / Error Report\r\nNo errors for this, just observed behavior.\r\n\r\n## Environment (Required)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]: Paper v1_14_R1 (173)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]: CS-CoreLib vDEV - 66 (git 9174f09d)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]: Slimefun vDEV - 142 (git 0d7fc6af)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]: Installed Addons (7)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  Barrels vDEV - 2 (git 847bc83b)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  ExtraGear vDEV - 3 (git de222ab7)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  ChestTerminal v1.0\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  HotbarPets vDEV - 10 (git 7d790905)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  ExoticGarden vDEV - 17 (git 122f5555)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  SoulJars vDEV - 3 (git ebabf39f)\r\n[10:49:14 INFO]:  ElectricSpawners vDEV - 2 (git 49ffa319)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/labels/Bug%20Report","name":"Bug Report","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T00:34:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n"}]
